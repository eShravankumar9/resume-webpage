                        <p>In my role as a Data Engineer at Johnson & Johnson, I spearheaded critical tasks in projects involving data migration to Azure cloud. I conducted thorough data analysis to understand existing structures and devised optimal solutions for seamless migration. Leveraging Azure Data Factory (ADF), I developed and implemented robust ETL pipelines to efficiently transfer data from Oracle DB and SQL Server to Azure SQL Server. Additionally, I took charge of managing cloud databases, ensuring data integrity throughout migration and ongoing operations. Utilizing tools like Power BI, I created insightful dashboards and reports to visualize key metrics, particularly sales trends, aiding in informed decision-making. Proactively monitoring data pipelines and swiftly addressing any issues were vital aspects of ensuring smooth operations and data reliability. My role emphasized leveraging cloud technologies and ETL processes to drive actionable insights and enhance overall business operations.</p>

                            In my role as a Data Engineer & Analytics professional at META, I led critical initiatives to enhance data pipelines and reporting processes. One notable project involved rebuilding the SBG (Small Business Group) pipeline, where I optimized code readability and execution time. By migrating legacy pipelines and updating logic to optimize code, I achieved significant improvements, reducing execution time from 7 hours to 4.5 hours. Additionally, I focused on streamlining data integration workflows and resolving data issues within SBG Weekly reports and Data Playground Dashboards using tools like Hadoop, Hive, and Apache Spark. These enhancements resulted in a 20% increase in data processing speed and optimized memory usage, significantly enhancing dashboard performance and user experience. Throughout these projects, I also provided on-call support, monitoring pipeline failures through DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) setups, and addressed production issues promptly to ensure data continuity and reliability.</p>
